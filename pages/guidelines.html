<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TL;DR ("too long; didn't read")</a></h2>
<p>(TL;DR is a familiar term from social media circa 2020.)</p>
<p>Important things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in discussion and complete the assignments.</li>
<li>Present readings twice during the term. Post discussion questions on Canvas at least 48 hours in advance of the presentation.</li>
<li>Write a one-page Final Project Proposal.</li>
<li>Present (a preview of) your Final Project to your peers in the "Poster" session.</li>
<li>Complete the Final Project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Programming Questions</h2>
<p>Post programming questions and questions about the assignments on Canvas in the
"Discussions" section.</p>
<h2>Presentation Sign-up</h2>
<p>Students will present the assigned reading to the class twice during the term.
Students may present in groups of two or three if they wish. PhD students
presenting in groups must work with other PhD students.</p>
<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>Readings not available on the Internet are in the "Files" section on Canvas.
Slides and handouts will be posted in the "Files" section on Canvas.</p>
<h2>Presentation Guidelines</h2>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post questions for the class to consider on Canvas (in the "Discussions" section) at least two days before the presentation.</li>
<li>Practice the presentation at least once to make sure the presentation lasts for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Focus on describing the contribution of the paper (e.g., the main research question). The particular methods used are typically not essential.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>Twice during the term (on distinct days) you will present one assigned paper to
the rest of the class. You may work with up to two partners on both of these
occasions. The student (or group of students) should also circulate reading
questions for the papers they present at least two days in advance of their
presentation. Students are encouraged to come to office hours to discuss the
paper they have chosen to present.</p>
<p>Answering the following questions might structure a presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main contribution of the paper?</li>
<li>Why is this contribution important?</li>
<li>What is not clear to you?</li>
<li>What did the authors fail to include?</li>
<li>What are the most important assumptions made, are they limiting?</li>
<li>What applications does this contribution suggest?</li>
<li>How does this paper connect with other topics encountered in the course?</li>
</ul>
<p>The presentation should help other members of the class understand the paper.
For this reason it is essential that the presentation be addressed to the
other members of the class and not just a subset. Be very careful about the
assumptions you make about the prior knowledge of the audience. For example, if
a significant minority of the class does not have the mathematical or
statistical background required to understand the technical details of a paper
as they appear in the methods section of the paper, you must adapt your
presentation accordingly. Keep your audience engaged.</p>
<p>Again, please do not focus on methods at the expense of discussion of the main
research question.</p>
<p>(Adapted from presentation guidelines for Yiling Chen's "Topics at the
Interface between Computer Science and Economics.")</p>
<h2>Final Project Guidelines</h2>
<p>If your Final Project involves data analysis, it must have the following
sections. (The structure of literature review papers may differ.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract: Summarize your work. Identify your contribution and/or research
    question. (1 paragraph)</li>
<li>Introduction: Describe your contribution and/or research question. Preview
    the data and methods used. (~2-3 paragraphs)</li>
<li>Related work: Review related work thematically. For example, if the work
    was about emotions, you could have one paragraph describing each of the
    following: definition of emotions, and categorization; applications, and
    why it is useful or important to do emotion detection; emotion research by
    genre/domain. This section typically reviews between 5 and 15 papers and/or
    other sources.</li>
<li>Data: Describe the dataset you used. Do not assume the reader knows
    anything about the data. Visually appealing presentations of summary
    statistics are almost always welcome. Describe how you collected your own
    dataset in detail. If your data includes annotations or labels provided by
    humans, describe in detail how they were gathered. </li>
<li>Methods: Describe what category of methods used (e.g., supervised,
    semi-supervised, unsupervised). Describe the machine learning classifier
    (e.g., naive Bayes, support vector machines). What tool (e.g., nltk,
    sklearn) did you use?</li>
<li>Evaluation: Describe the evaluation metric you are using. Have some sort of
    baseline with which you compare your results. For example, a classifier
    which simply picks the majority class would be a baseline which your method
    would hopefully best.</li>
<li>Discussion and Conclusion: Summarize your results and how they answer (or
    fail to answer!) the research question. Talk about limitations of your work
    (e.g., something you should have done but did not do). Talk about future
    directions (what would you do if you had more time, what extensions of your
    work or system, what other datasets you may use in the future.</li>
<li>References: Cite all your references clearly. Use ACL style and format. Use
    ACL style files for LaTeX or Word
    <a href="http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Masters students may work in teams. No more than 3 people may be on a team.</p>
<p><strong>Non-goals of the final project.</strong> Please do not perform a superficial data analysis of some pre-existing dataset. If your final project involves data analysis, the final project should have a form which is roughly similar to those papers we have seen during the term. In particular, you need to identify the question you are seeking to answer and how it differs from or is similar to existing work.</p>
<h3>Recommended Reading for Final Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037">Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Datasets for Final Projects</h3>
<p>You may use any of the following datasets for your final project. If you want
to use a different dataset you must speak with the instructor in advance. (In
the past, students have found that they do not have enough time during the
semester to collect new datasets.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Reddit Comments Dataset (<a href="https://archive.org/details/2015_reddit_comments_corpus">JSON</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2015_reddit_comments_corpus_sqlite">SQLite3</a>)</li>
<li>Amazon Q/A Data (UCSD Amazon Product Data)</li>
<li>Amazon Reviews (UCSD Amazon Product Data)</li>
<li>Enron Email Dataset</li>
<li>GitHub (on Google BigQuery)</li>
<li>Hacker News</li>
<li>Stackoverflow (on Google BigQuery)</li>
<li>Twitter (PAN Profiling Task)</li>
<li>Twitter (US Congress Twitter Dataset)</li>
<li>Wikipedia (API or Dumps)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using one of the datasets listed above is <strong>strongly recommended</strong>.</p>
<h2>Poster Session</h2>
<p>We will hold a poster session during which you will present the results of your
work in the form of a poster.</p>
