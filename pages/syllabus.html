            <h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Social media is in a pre-Newtonian moment, where we all understand
that it works, but not how it works. --Kevin Systrom, cofounder of Instagram</p>
<p>"Es ist schon alles gesagt, nur noch nicht von allen." --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Valentin">Karl
Valentin</a> (Translation: It's
been said before, but it hasn't yet been said by everyone.)</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- Many who are important, believe themselves to be important, or wish to be
important, express themselves on social media even though nobody in particular
is necessarily interested in hearing them. -->

<p>The number of active users of social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit,
Weibo (新浪微博), YouTube, and Facebook continues to grow. In light of this
growth, interest in analyzing the data generated by users' interactions (often
labeled "digital trace data") is considerable.  This course prepares students
to collect and analyze social media data using the Python programming language.
Equal emphasis is placed on learning concepts and mastering the computing tools
needed to apply them.</p>
<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>As a result of completing this course, the student should gain familiarity with
different uses of social media data as well as with common methods used in the
analysis of user-generated content. Students will also gain familiarity with
the task of implementing some of these analyses using Python. Students will also develop
an understanding of the varied social, political, and economic uses of social media data.</p>
<h2>Textbooks</h2>
<p><em>There are no required textbooks for this class.</em> There are two recommended
Python references. If you are new to Python you likely want one of them. Those
who have no prior programming experience will likely want to acquire <em>Automate
the Boring Stuff with Python</em> by Al Sweigart (ISBN: 978-1593275990). (The book
is also available in <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">HTML format
online</a>.) Those with some prior
programming experience and those who enjoy mathematics may prefer <em>Introduction
to Computation and Programming Using Python</em> by Guttag (ISBN: 9780262529624).</p>
<p>The following textbooks are also recommended for those interested in
understanding in greater detail the range of methods discussed in the readings:
Hand et al. (2001) <em>Principles of Data Mining</em> (ISBN: 9780262082907) and Newman
(2010) <em>Networks: An Introduction</em> (ISBN: 9780199206650)</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>This class meets in 3-hour sessions over a whole semester. The instructor
will be available for office hours for 1 hour per week.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Some programming experience is preferred but is not strictly required for this
course. Basic Unix skills are required. For example, students should understand
how to navigate the filesystem and edit text files. Students wishing to review
these topics should consult Software Carpentry's <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">"The Unix
Shell"</a>.</p>
<h2>Course Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>Readings</strong>: This course will be run in seminar style, and discussion and active
involvement in the class activities will play an important role. The quantity
and quality of contributions made to class count for 30% of the grade. Students
are expected to read the assigned readings each week and to be prepared to
discuss them in class. Readings associated with the second week of class, for
example, should be completed before attending class.</p>
<p><strong>Class Presentations</strong>: Students will present the assigned reading to the class,
potentially in a group, twice over the course of the semester. We will form
groups and each group will be responsible for presenting some of the papers we
will be reading for the class. For your presentation, you are expected to read
the papers and prepare slides to present them. Each of the two presentations is
worth 10% of your final grade, for a total of 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Final Project</strong>: Students are required to write a term paper. The term paper can
be either (1) a literature review, an extensive survey (ca. 4000-6000 words) of previous work on one
or more research areas featured in the course or (2) a technical report (ca.
3000-5000 words) describing the analysis of one or more social media corpora. (The technical report may also be a replication of a study we encountered during the course.)
This analysis need not be focused on a task discussed in the course; it can be
any task you are interested in, provided it relates to the analysis of social
media data. Students will submit a one-page Final Project Proposal identifying
the task/topic, research question(s), methods, and data on which the paper will
be based. The final paper/report should follow the formal conventions for a
publishable-quality research article, including footnotes and citations of
scholarly work in ACL format (available from the ACL (see <a href="http://acl2015.org/call_for_papers.html">section
"Format"</a>; LaTex:
<a href="http://acl2015.org/files/acl2015.tex">acl2015.tex</a>,
<a href="http://acl2015.org/files/acl2015.sty">acl2015.sty</a>,
<a href="http://acl2015.org/files/acl2015.pdf">acl2015.pdf</a>,
<a href="http://acl2015.org/files/acl2015.bst">acl.bst</a>; MS Word:
<a href="http://acl2015.org/files/acl2015.dot">acl2015.dot</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Final Project Proposal</strong>: Masters students must write a proposal of at least
750 words excluding references. PhD students must write a longer proposal (at
least 1250 words, excluding references). If writing a literature review, the
proposal should discuss the motivation for the project and identify specific
research questions which will anchor the literature review. Projects involving
data analysis must commit to using a specific dataset at the time of the
proposal. The dataset selected and described in the proposal must be the same
dataset used in the final project.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong>: You must complete programming assignments. These are graded on a pass/fail basis. All serious efforts will receive full credit.</p>
<p><strong>Other</strong>: You are expected to check your email at a regular basis (e.g.,
at least twice between class meetings, including the morning before class).</p>
<h2>Grades</h2>
<p>Your grade for the course will be calculated as follows:</p>
<!-- Fall 2020 remove in-person participation -->

<ul>
<li>
<p>Class Participation and Activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem Sets (15%)</li>
<li>Participation (5%)  <!-- suspended due to covid --></li>
<li>Project Proposal (15%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Presentations: 15%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final Project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Project Presentation: 10%</li>
<li>Final Project Paper: 40%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Class Participation &amp; Activities</h3>
<p>Class discussion and activities are an important part of the course. Class
participation means being willing and prepared to speak intelligently in class
about the topics under discussion. In order to be able to speak intelligently
about a topic, you will need to have done the readings for that topic. You will
also need to be physically present and alert. In addition, to emphasize
hands-on experience, you will be expected to use your computer/laptop to try
out tasks as described in the syllabus.</p>
<p>Don't come to class if you feel unwell!</p>
<!-- removed in 2020 and 2021 for covid , removal above too -->

<!--
Participation in class discussion and activities require attendance.
Legitimate reasons for missing class include: personal issues, illness,
interview, conference travel, etc. Personal travel and exploration, assignments
due in other classes, personal errands, and other such excuses are not
accepted. Inform the instructor of a planned absence via [this
form](https://docs.google.com/a/iu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHbyOGUrB7MFkcuuI45gpa1E4FoLHFgiUqmO1zRFXvUt03cA/viewform)
**before** class.
-->

<h3>Reading Responses</h3>
<p>The day before each class, post a short response to one or more of the assigned
readings. You might comment on the organization of the paper or identify
something that a paper does well (or poorly).</p>
<h3>Class Presentations</h3>
<p>You will be expected to present to the class, potentially in a group, twice
over the course of the semester. We will form groups and each group will be
responsible for presenting some of the papers we will be reading for the class.
For your presentation, you are expected to read the papers well and prepare
slides to present them.</p>
<h3>Final Project</h3>
<p>The term paper will be graded on content--originality of the research question,
appropriateness of the data and SMM methods (and deployment therein in possibly
working code) used to investigate the question, plausibility of your
interpretations--and form--organization, clarity and quality of written
expression, and appropriate use of scholarly conventions such as citations and
footnotes. An 'A' quality term paper addresses an interesting research
question, makes use of an appropriate empirical method to mine SMM data, and
interprets the findings thoughtfully, in addition to being well-organized and
clearly and professionally written and possibly accompanied by working code.</p>
<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>Students come to this class with a wide range of skills and prior knowledge. In
recognition of this, individual assignments will be graded in such a way that
almost all valid submissions receive full credit.  Assignments will typically
be given an initial score using a scale ranging from 0 to 130. This score is
not your grade. All submissions which demonstrate effort will receive full
credit.</p>
<h3>Grades at ILS</h3>
<p>The following letter grade-to-GPA relationships have been defined, and been
approved by the faculty (November 11, 1996), as an aid in the evaluation of
academic performance as well as to assist students by giving them an
understanding of the grading standards of the Department of Information and
Library Science (ILS).</p>
